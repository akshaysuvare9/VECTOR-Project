# VECTOR-Project
This is my Real Time Weather Monitoring Project.
<br>
I used different sensors, converter & chips in this prject.
<br>
LDR -> To sence the light intensity.
MCP3204 -> ADC. To covert the light intensity into digital signal.
M24C08 -> EEPROM. To store the logs into the memory.
DS1621 -> Digital Thermometer. To sense the temperature and converts into digital signals.
DS1307 -> RTC. To provide real time clock

Protocols Used:
UART
I2C
SPI

Microcontroller used:
AT89C51
